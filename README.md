# Ideabox: Note Taking App
### Group Project by: Jim Charnesky, Naomi Ware, Linus Leas

This was a group project for Mod 1 of Turing school of Software & Design

Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say "the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them."

### Learning Goals:
- Create HTML framework for note-taking app
- Use CSS to style and create a 'responsive client-side interface'
- Write clean, DRY javascript to store data
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded by allowing the user to add/remove/update ideas on the DOM
- Utilize event bubbling on dynamic elements

### Wins:
- Better understanding between HTML, JavaScript, and CSS
- More experience with Flex Box and media queries
- Gained confidence with AdjacentHTML and event bubbling
- More experience pairing remotely and adapting to changing situations
- Successfully coordinating schedules of teammates during enforced remote work during CoVid pandemic

### Challenges
- Connectivity issues
- Debugging CSS was particularly challenging
- Accomplishing project goals under strict time constraints
- First project where HTML and CSS docs were not provided

### Overview of Project:
Created a responsive web-page using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, allowing users to save ideas. The User has the ability to:
- Create notecard with their idea on it
- Mark favorite cards
- Delete notecards that have been created
- Are able to view their app via laptop or mobile devices
